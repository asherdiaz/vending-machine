# vending-machine
This virtual vending machine is a command-line application where users can feed money into a bank account and purchase products.

# Description
I created a command line application which allows users to feed money into a bank account and purchase a selection of products from a pre-loaded inventory. The virtual vending machine displays the inventory and gives users the ability to add money to their account to make a transaction. The inventory is loaded from a .txt file using File I/O.
